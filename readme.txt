the screen shot on the plugin page. Fixed height so now you can set your own custom height instead of having
it automatically set with the width. Removed screen shots that are not needed any more save more space for users.
Also last but not least I added a preview video on the admin page as promised.

== About ==
This plugin was made by <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/shobba/">Shobba</a>. He has been
MIA and so I contacted WordPress and asked if I could take it over. Ever since the plugin has been
updated. 

This plugin has been fixed by the community as well with their patches I have added them into the plugin
it self and I have also upgraded the admin page hopefully its a bit more visual for people. 2.0 may be the
last big update for awhile until we get more ideas from the community and so on.

Enjoy the plugin!
