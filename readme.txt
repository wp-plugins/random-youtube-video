* 1.9 - Fixed the widget now it is more modernized which means you can add as many widgets as you want to your sidebar! Community 
suggestion! This has been tested in Firefox and IE and with the latest wordpress! I also made a new page for the widget to make it
cleaner for any developers that like to add or delete stuff :)! No more error log!
* 2.0 - Cleaned up the entire code now in DIVS no more tables. The admin page looks a lot different now view
the screen shot on the plugin page. Fixed height so now you can set your own custom height instead of having
it automatically set with the width. Removed screen shots that are not needed any more save more space for users.
Also last but not least I added a preview video on the admin page as promised.
* 2.1 - Added a new style sheet. So users could keep there changed colors during updates. Fixed most of the rare bugs. 
Updated the YouTube player this has the latest iframe version. Removed auto width/height did not work that great on all 
websites now you can choose in pixles! Updated some of the php code. This caused php errors and people who are hosted with 
Windows could not activate the plugin. Added a checkbox for AutoPlay option instead of manually typing it in. This should
work 100% on release tested with version 4.0 and up!
* 2.2 - Fixed rare bug made the video disappear I believe it had to do with the data code at the end.
